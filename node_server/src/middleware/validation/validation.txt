Here's how you can implement a secure password verification function using the crypto package instead of bcrypt. 
This will match the pattern (salt:hash) set during password hashing.

Retrieve Salt and Hash:

The stored password follows the salt:hash pattern (set during hashing).
The split(":") method separates the salt and hash values.
Hash the Provided Password:

The crypto.pbkdf2Sync() function uses the stored salt to hash the password provided in the request.
It ensures the hashing process matches the original.
Compare Hashes:

The hash generated from the provided password is compared to the stored hash.
If they match, the password is valid.
Error Handling:

If hashing fails or the hashes don't match, appropriate error messages are returned.
